          <h2>The Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Scotland</h2>
          <div class="col-7" style="padding-top: 3%;">
            <p>The coronavirus outbreak hits the economy of Scotland as it affects the economy of every country in the world.
              In addition to the impact of the corona epidemic, Scotland is also facing huge economic uncertainty as a result of Brexit and the UK Government’s decision to leave the transition period on December 31 in the middle of the pandemic.
              As a result of the 3 Lockdown periods, restaurants and shops were closed, causing many businesses to shrink or even close.
              The shrinkage of companies and the fact that places such as restaurants, bars and cafes do not work as usual, also affected unemployment rates.

                <p>Unemployment in Scotland fell slightly between August and October, new figures show.
                   The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the unemployment rate among those aged 16 and over was 4.2% – 0.6% down on the previous quarter.
                   The employment rate for those aged 16 to 64 was 74.8%, a 1.4% increase on the previous quarter.
                   The ONS said the rise was partly caused by the record increase in the employment level, of 57,000.
                   There were 2.67 million people aged 16 and over in employment, while 118,000 in that age range were unemployed.
                   Business Minister Jamie Hepburn said: “For August to October 2020, Scotland’s employment rate estimate has risen over the quarter to 74.8% and the unemployment rate estimate has fallen over the quarter to 4.2%.</p>

                <p>According to recent studies, those working in low-wage sectors were affected negatively during this period. Higher paying jobs are more likely to be
                  able to continue work from home when compored to those in lower paid and manual jobs. The blue-collar workers, 
                  who cannot carry their jobs home, is not satisfied with the lockdowns that happened one after another.
